This project illustrates some of the algorithms from Game AI pro volume 3 book(2) and Algorithms And Networking for games book(1). 

Random numbers and basic stuff are from book 1.
First we have the algoritms of Section 2, which are faster to illustrate. 

I have also added some basic Game Object implementations.
